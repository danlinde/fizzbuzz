FizzBuzz
========

One of the first excercises we did at Makers Academy was FizzBuzz.

FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Here is a summary of what is in this repository:

* FizzBuzz.rb - my first implementation of FizzBuzz
* Fizzling - which includes Fizzling1 a redo of FizzBuzz.rb using classes, TDD & RSpec, and Fizzling2 a slight modification of Fizzling1 without RSpec 
* FizzBuzz2 - a refactor of Fizzling after a bit more RSpec study
* EnumFizzBuzz - an implementation using the Enumerator class

If you can't get enough FizzBuzz, see also my "week9-test" repository which features the method fizzbuzz_without_modulo in questions.rb
